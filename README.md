The company I found [WideFix](https://widefix.com/) provides the best Ruby on Rails application's maintenance. We share our work as much as possible at the [company's GitHub account](https://github.com/widefix). 

I'm a sole author of a book [Rake Task Management Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/product/rake-task-management-essentials/9781783280773). 

Below you see stats of my contribution to these projects, including private repositories of the companies we help.
