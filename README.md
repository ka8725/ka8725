I love Ruby, passionate about clean software architecture, code performance, readability, simplicity, and maintainability. I'm a sole author of a book [Rake Task Management Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/product/rake-task-management-essentials/9781783280773).

I'm a founder of [WideFix](https://widefix.com/) custom software development company that provides the best Ruby on Rails application's maintenance ([see our clients reviews](https://clutch.co/profile/widefix#reviews)). We share our work as much as possible at the [company's GitHub account](https://github.com/widefix). 

Below you see stats of my contribution to these projects, including private repositories of the companies we help.
